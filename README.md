## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Required Dependencies
Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Or install all requirements at once:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Test Scenarios

The module includes five predefined scenarios to demonstrate different biometric system behaviors:

1. **Balanced**: Equal distribution with good overall performance
2. **Imbalanced**: Skewed data distribution (common in biometrics)
3. **High Precision**: Few false positives, more false negatives
4. **High Recall**: Few false negatives, more false positives
5. **Poor Performance**: High error rates across all metrics

## Educational Use

This module is designed for educational purposes to help students understand:
- Trade-offs between precision and recall in biometric systems
- Visual interpretation of confusion matrices
- Impact of data distribution on performance metrics
- Practical implications of different error types in biometric authentication
